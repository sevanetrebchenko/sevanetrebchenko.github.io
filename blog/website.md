## Where Am I?

Welcome to my website! This is a space I've made for myself to be able to share screenshots, videos, code snippets, and in-depth explanations on work of mine that I find interesting and noteworthy. 

You can expect projects and posts about anything related to computer graphics, descriptions of rendering techniques, and game engine architecture, to name a few. Stick around, and be sure to check out some of the things I've written about! I have a (seemingly) endless list of projects I want to get around to building, and there will be updates whenever I do.

## What's Next?

That's about it for this time, thanks for reading! Feel free to reach out to me with any inquiries or questions you may have.
